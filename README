Java 1.8 is required

——————-
Dependencies:

junit 4.11 (for tests)

——————-
Some remarks:

Initially I thought the Drones were meant to adjust speed/bearing to reach a destination at given time, as in method Drone.runTimer().
A simpler method of setting lat/lon at correct time was later thought of, most of the method/state of Drone can therefore be removed if starting thread by Drone.run()

——————-
Improvements:

Queue of destinations in Drone (_destinations) needs locking/synchronization.

Usage:

($ mkdir bin)
$ javac -d bin/ src/drones/*.java
$ java -cp bin drones.Program
Sending initial destinations to drone 5937
Sending initial destinations to drone 6043
Drone 6043 is sending report from "Pimlico" to Dispatcher
Dispatcher is reporting traffic: 6043, 08:01:43, 0.000000, LIGHT
Drone 5937 is sending report from "Elephant & Castle" to Dispatcher
Dispatcher is reporting traffic: 5937, 08:03:47, 0.000000, MODERATE
...
Shutting down at 08:10
