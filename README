Java 1.8 is required


Dependencies:

junit 4.11 (for tests)


Some remarks:

Initially I thought the Drones were meant to adjust speed/bearing to reach a destination at given time, as in method Drone.runTimer().
A simpler method of setting lat/lon at correct time was later thought of, most of the method/state of Drone can therefore be removed
if starting thread by Drone.run()


Improvements:

Queue of destinations in Drone (_destinations) needs locking/synchronization
